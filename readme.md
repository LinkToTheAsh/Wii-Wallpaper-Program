# External script for [Wii wallpaper](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3526096300) by [Lillykyu](https://www.lillykyu.gay/)


## Usage instructions
**NOTE: make sure your path to where you extract it does not have a space in it! powershell is terrible**

**Another note: this does not directly support applications with arguments, if you wish to run an application with arguments, either create a shortcut to it and add that to info.txt, or create a bat script that runs your app and add that**

1. Download the zip file from releases.
2. Extract into a folder
3. Enable Verbose logging in wallpaper engine
4. Open a powershell window as admin and run ``Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted``
5. Edit the info.txt with your executables and log path in the format shown in the file
6. Run ``install.bat`` and if that succeeds then run ``start.bat``

If you need to make any edits, run ``stop.bat``, edit your info.txt then run ``start.bat`` to restart it

Once that is done, you dont need to do anything else, just keep these files and the script will automatically start upon reboots!
If you wish to uninstall the program, run ``uninstall.bat``, delete these files and your done!
